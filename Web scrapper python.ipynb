      " Guido van Rossum at OSCON 2006\n",
      "Main article: History of Python\n",
      "Python was conceived in the late 1980s[37] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to  ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL,[38] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[9] Its implementation began in December 1989.[39] Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his \"permanent vacation\" from his responsibilities as Python's Benevolent Dictator For Life, a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker.[40] He now shares his leadership as a member of a five-person steering council.[41][42][43] In January 2019, active Python core developers elected Brett Cannon, Nick Coghlan, Barry Warsaw, Carol Willing and Van Rossum to a five-member \"Steering Council\" to lead the project.[44] Guido van Rossum has since then withdrawn his nomination for the 2020 Steering council.[45]\n",
      "Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000 with many major new features, including a cycle-detecting garbage collector and support for Unicode.[46]\n",
      "Python 3.0 was released on 3 December 2008. It was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible.[47] Many of its major features were backported to Python 2.6.x[48] and 2.7.x version series.  Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates (at least partially) the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.[49]\n",
      "Python 2.7's end-of-life date was initially set at 2015 then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.[50][51]  No more security patches or other improvements will be released for it.[52][53] With Python 2's end-of-life, only  Python 3.6.x[54] and later are supported.\n",
      "\n",
      "Design philosophy and features[edit]\n",
      "Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of its features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming (including by metaprogramming[55] and metaobjects (magic methods)).[56] Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract[57][58] and logic programming.[59]\n",
      "Python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management.[60] It also features dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution.\n",
      "Python's design offers some support for functional programming in the Lisp tradition. It has filter, map, and reduce functions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets, and generator expressions.[61] The standard library has two modules (itertools and functools) that implement functional tools borrowed from Haskell and Standard ML.[62]\n",
      "The language's core philosophy is summarized in the document The Zen of Python (PEP 20), which includes aphorisms such as:[63]\n",
      "\n",
      "Beautiful is better than ugly.\n",
      "Explicit is better than implicit.\n",
      "Simple is better than complex.\n",
      "Complex is better than complicated.\n",
      "Readability counts.\n",
      "Rather than having all of its functionality built into its core, Python was designed to be highly extensible. This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. Van Rossum's vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with ABC, which espoused the opposite approach.[37]\n",
      "Python strives for a simpler, less-cluttered syntax and grammar while giving developers a choice in their coding methodology. In contrast to Perl's \"there is more than one way to do it\" motto, Python embraces a \"there should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it\" design philosophy.[63] Alex Martelli, a Fellow at the Python Software Foundation and Python book author, writes that \"To describe something as 'clever' is not considered a compliment in the Python culture.\"[64]\n",
      "Python's developers strive to avoid premature optimization, and reject patches to non-critical parts of the CPython reference implementation that would offer marginal increases in speed at the cost of clarity.[65] When speed is important, a Python programmer can move time-critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as C, or use PyPy, a just-in-time compiler. Cython is also available, which translates a Python script into C and makes direct C-level API calls into the Python interpreter.\n",
      "An important goal of Python's developers is keeping it fun to use. This is reflected in the language's name—a tribute to the British comedy group Monty Python[66]—and in occasionally playful approaches to tutorials and reference materials, such as examples that refer to spam and eggs (from a famous Monty Python sketch) instead of the standard foo and bar.[67][68]\n",
      "A common neologism in the Python community is pythonic, which can have a wide range of meanings related to program style. To say that code is pythonic is to say that it uses Python idioms well, that it is natural or shows fluency in the language, that it conforms with Python's minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability. In contrast, code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called unpythonic.[69][70]\n",
      "Users and admirers of Python, especially those considered knowledgeable or experienced, are often referred to as Pythonistas.[71][72]\n",
      "\n",
      "Syntax and semantics[edit]\n",
      "Main article: Python syntax and semantics\n",
      "It has been suggested that this article be merged with Python syntax and semantics. (Discuss) Proposed since January 2021.\n",
      "Python is meant to be an easily readable language. Its formatting is visually uncluttered, and it often uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation. Unlike many other languages, it does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are optional. It has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than C or Pascal.[73]\n",
      "\n",
      "Indentation[edit]\n",
      "Main article: Python syntax and semantics § Indentation\n",
      "Python uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks. An increase in indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block.[74] Thus, the program's visual structure accurately represents the program's semantic structure.[1] This feature is sometimes termed the off-side rule, which some other languages share, but in most languages indentation doesn't have any semantic meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Statements and control flow[edit]\n",
      "Python's statements include (among others):\n",
      "\n",
      "The assignment statement (token '=', the equals sign).\n",
      "The if statement, which conditionally executes a block of code, along with else and elif (a contraction of else-if).\n",
      "The for statement, which iterates over an iterable object, capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block.\n",
      "The while statement, which executes a block of code as long as its condition is true.\n",
      "The try statement, which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and handled by except clauses; it also ensures that clean-up code in a finally block will always be run regardless of how the block exits.\n",
      "The raise statement, used to raise a specified exception or re-raise a caught exception.\n",
      "The class statement, which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a class, for use in object-oriented programming.\n",
      "The def statement, which defines a function or method.\n",
      "The with statement, from Python 2.5 released in September 2006,[75] which encloses a code block within a context manager (for example, acquiring a lock before the block of code is run and releasing the lock afterwards, or opening a file and then closing it), allowing Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII)-like behavior and replaces a common try/finally idiom.[76]\n",
      "The break statement, exits from the loop.\n",
      "The continue statement, skips this iteration and continues with the next item.\n",
      "The del statement, removes a variable, which means the reference from the name to the value is deleted and trying to use that variable cause an error. A deleted variable can be reassigned.\n",
      "The pass statement, which serves as a NOP. It is syntactically needed to create an empty code block.\n",
      "The assert statement, used during debugging to check for conditions that ought to apply.\n",
      "The yield statement, which returns a value from a generator function. From Python 2.5, yield is also an operator. This form is used to implement coroutines.\n",
      "The  return statement, used to return a value from a function.\n",
      "The import statement, which is used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used in the current program. There are three ways of using import: import <module name> [as <alias>] or from <module name> import * or from <module name> import <definition 1> [as <alias 1>], <definition 2> [as <alias 2>], ....\n",
      "The print statement was changed to the print() function in Python 3.\n",
      "The assignment statement ('=') operates by binding a name as a reference to a separate, dynamically-allocated object. Since the name's storage location doesn't contain the indicated value, it is improper to call it a variable. Names may be subsequently rebound at any time to any object. Since a name is a generic reference holder it is unreasonable to associate a fixed data type with it. However at a given time, a name will be bound to some object, which will have a type. This association is referred to as dynamic typing.\n",
      "Python does not support tail call optimization or first-class continuations, and, according to Guido van Rossum, it never will.[77][78] However, better support for coroutine-like functionality is provided in 2.5, by extending Python's generators.[79] Before 2.5, generators were lazy iterators; information was passed unidirectionally out of the generator. From Python 2.5, it is possible to pass information back into a generator function, and from Python 3.3, the information can be passed through multiple stack levels.[80]\n",
      "\n",
      "Expressions[edit]\n",
      "Some Python expressions are similar to languages such as C and Java, while some are not:\n",
      "\n",
      "Addition, subtraction, and multiplication are the same, but the behavior of division differs. There are two types of divisions in Python. They are floor division (or integer division) // and floating-point/division.[81] Python also added the ** operator for exponentiation.\n",
      "From Python 3.5, the new @ infix operator was introduced. It is intended to be used by libraries such as NumPy for matrix multiplication.[82][83]\n",
      "From Python 3.8, the syntax :=, called the 'walrus operator' was introduced. It assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression.[84]\n",
      "In Python, == compares by value, versus Java, which compares numerics by value[85] and objects by reference.[86] (Value comparisons in Java on objects can be performed with the equals() method.) Python's is operator may be used to compare object identities (comparison by reference). In Python, comparisons may be chained, for example a <= b <= c.\n",
      "Python uses the words and, or, not for its boolean operators rather than the symbolic &&, ||, ! used in Java and C.\n",
      "Python has a type of expression termed a list comprehension. Python 2.4 extended list comprehensions into a more general expression termed a generator expression.[61]\n",
      "Anonymous functions are implemented using lambda expressions; however, these are limited in that the body can only be one expression.\n",
      "Conditional expressions in Python are written as x if c else y[87] (different in order of operands from the c ? x : y operator common to many other languages).\n",
      "Python makes a distinction between lists and tuples. Lists are written as [1, 2, 3], are mutable, and cannot be used as the keys of dictionaries (dictionary keys must be immutable in Python). Tuples are written as (1, 2, 3), are immutable and thus can be used as the keys of dictionaries, provided all elements of the tuple are immutable. The + operator can be used to concatenate two tuples, which does not directly modify their contents, but rather produces a new tuple containing the elements of both provided tuples. Thus, given the variable t initially equal to (1, 2, 3), executing t = t + (4, 5) first evaluates t + (4, 5), which yields (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), which is then assigned back to t, thereby effectively \"modifying the contents\" of t, while conforming to the immutable nature of tuple objects. Parentheses are optional for tuples in unambiguous contexts.[88]\n",
      "Python features sequence unpacking wherein multiple expressions, each evaluating to anything that can be assigned to (a variable, a writable property, etc.), are associated in an identical manner to that forming tuple literals and, as a whole, are put on the left-hand side of the equal sign in an assignment statement. The statement expects an iterable object on the right-hand side of the equal sign that produces the same number of values as the provided writable expressions when iterated through and will iterate through it, assigning each of the produced values to the corresponding expression on the left.[89]\n",
      "Python has a \"string format\" operator %. This functions analogously to printf format strings in C, e.g. \"spam=%s eggs=%d\" % (\"blah\", 2) evaluates to \"spam=blah eggs=2\". In Python 3 and 2.6+, this was supplemented by the format() method of the str class, e.g. \"spam={0} eggs={1}\".format(\"blah\", 2). Python 3.6 added \"f-strings\": blah = \"blah\"; eggs = 2; f'spam={blah} eggs={eggs}'.[90]\n",
      "Strings in Python can be concatenated, by \"adding\" them (same operator as for adding integers and floats). E.g. \"spam\" + \"eggs\" returns \"spameggs\". Even if your strings contain numbers, they are still added as strings rather than integers. E.g. \"2\" + \"2\" returns \"22\".\n",
      "Python has various kinds of string literals:\n",
      "Strings delimited by single or double quote marks. Unlike in Unix shells, Perl and Perl-influenced languages, single quote marks and double quote marks function identically.

Slices take elements from the start index up to, but not including, the stop index. The third slice parameter, called step or stride, allows elements to be skipped and reversed. Slice indexes may be omitted, for example a[:] returns a copy of the entire list. Each element of a slice is a shallow copy.\n",

A particular case of this is that an assignment statement such as a = 1 cannot form part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement. This has the advantage of avoiding a classic C error of mistaking an assignment operator = for an equality operator == in conditions: if (c = 1) { ... } is syntactically valid (but probably unintended) C code but if c = 1: ... causes a syntax error in Python.\n",

Type constraints are not checked at compile time; rather, operations on an object may fail, signifying that the given object is not of a suitable type. Despite being dynamically-typed, Python is strongly-typed, forbidding operations that are not well-defined (for example, adding a number to a string) rather than silently attempting to make sense of them.\n",
      "Python allows programmers to define their own types using classes, which are most often used for object-oriented programming. New instances of classes are constructed by calling the class (for example, SpamClass() or EggsClass()), and the classes are instances of the metaclass type (itself an instance of itself), allowing metaprogramming and reflection.\n",
      "Before version 3.0, Python had two kinds of classes: old-style and new-style.[92] The syntax of both styles is the same, the difference being whether the class object is inherited from, directly or indirectly (all new-style classes inherit from object and are instances of type). In versions of Python 2 from Python 2.2 onwards, both kinds of classes can be used. Old-style classes were eliminated in Python 3.0.\n",
      "The long-term plan is to support gradual typing[93] and from Python 3.5, the syntax of the language allows specifying static types but they are not checked in the default implementation, CPython. An experimental optional static type checker named mypy supports compile-time type checking.[94]\n",

It also has ** for exponentiation, e.g. 5**3 == 125 and 9**0.5 == 3.0, and a matrix multiply operator @ .[98] These operators work like in traditional math; with the same precedence rules, the operators infix ( + and - can also be unary to represent positive and negative numbers respectively).\n",
      "The division between integers produces floating-point results. The behavior of division has changed significantly over time:[99]\n",
      "\n",
      "Python 2.1 and earlier used C's division behavior. The / operator is integer division if both operands are integers, and floating-point division otherwise. Integer division rounds towards 0, e.g. 7/3 == 2 and -7/3 == -2.\n",
      "Python 2.2 changed integer division to round towards negative infinity, e.g. 7/3 == 2 and -7/3 == -3. The floor division // operator was introduced. So 7//3 == 2, -7//3 == -3, 7.5//3 == 2.0 and -7.5//3 == -3.0. Adding from __future__ import division causes a module to use Python 3.0 rules for division (see next).\n",
      "Python 3.0 changed / to always be floating-point division, e.g. 5/2 == 2.5.\n",
      "In Python terms, / is true division (or simply division), and // is floor division. / before version 3.0 is classic division.[99]\n",
      "Rounding towards negative infinity, though different from most languages, adds consistency. For instance, it means that the equation (a + b)//b == a//b + 1 is always true. It also means that the equation b*(a//b) + a%b == a is valid for both positive and negative values of a. However, maintaining the validity of this equation means that while the result of a%b is, as expected, in the half-open interval [0, b), where b is a positive integer, it has to lie in the interval (b, 0] when b is negative.[100]\n",
      "Python provides a round function for rounding a float to the nearest integer. For tie-breaking, Python 3 uses round to even: round(1.5) and round(2.5) both produce 2.[101] Versions before 3 used round-away-from-zero: round(0.5) is 1.0, round(-0.5) is −1.0.[102]\n",
      "Python allows boolean expressions with multiple equality relations in a manner that is consistent with general use in mathematics. For example, the expression a < b < c tests whether a is less than b and b is less than c.[103] C-derived languages interpret this expression differently: in C, the expression would first evaluate a < b, resulting in 0 or 1, and that result would then be compared with c.[104]\n",

      "Python has been successfully embedded in many software products as a scripting language, including in finite element method software such as Abaqus, 3D parametric modeler like FreeCAD, 3D animation packages such as 3ds Max, Blender, Cinema 4D, Lightwave, Houdini, Maya, modo, MotionBuilder, Softimage, the visual effects compositor Nuke, 2D imaging programs like GIMP,[179] Inkscape, Scribus and Paint Shop Pro,[180] and musical notation programs like scorewriter and capella. GNU Debugger uses Python as a pretty printer to show complex structures such as C++ containers. Esri promotes Python as the best choice for writing scripts in ArcGIS.[181] It has also been used in several video games,[182][183] and has been adopted as first of the three available programming languages in Google App Engine, the other two being Java and Go.[184]\n",
      "Many operating systems include Python as a standard component. It ships with most Linux distributions,[185] AmigaOS 4 (using Python 2.7), FreeBSD (as a package), NetBSD, OpenBSD (as a package) and macOS and can be used from the command line (terminal). Many Linux distributions use installers written in Python: Ubuntu uses the Ubiquity installer, while Red Hat Linux and Fedora use the Anaconda installer. Gentoo Linux uses Python in its package management system, Portage.\n",
      "Python is used extensively in the information security industry, including in exploit development.[186][187]\n",
      "Most of the Sugar software for the One Laptop per Child XO, now developed at Sugar Labs, is written in Python.[188] The Raspberry Pi single-board computer project has adopted Python as its main user-programming language.\n",
      "LibreOffice includes Python, and intends to replace Java with Python. Its Python Scripting Provider is a core feature[189] since Version 4.0 from 7 February 2013.\n",

      "Languages influenced by Python[edit]\n",
      "Python's design and philosophy have influenced many other programming languages:\n",
      "\n",
      "Boo uses indentation, a similar syntax, and a similar object model.[190]\n",
      "Cobra uses indentation and a similar syntax, and its Acknowledgements document lists Python first among languages that influenced it.[191]\n",
      "CoffeeScript, a programming language that cross-compiles to JavaScript, has Python-inspired syntax.\n",
      "ECMAScript/JavaScript borrowed iterators and generators from Python.[192]\n",
      "GDScript, a scripting language very similar to Python, built-in to the Godot game engine.[193]\n",
      "Go is designed for the \"speed of working in a dynamic language like Python\"[194] and shares the same syntax for slicing arrays.\n",
      "Groovy was motivated by the desire to bring the Python design philosophy to Java.[195]\n",
      "Julia was designed to be \"as usable for general programming as Python\".[25]\n",
      "Nim uses indentation and similar syntax.[196]\n",
      "Ruby's creator, Yukihiro Matsumoto, has said: \"I wanted a scripting language that was more powerful than Perl, and more object-oriented than Python. That's why I decided to design my own language.\"[197]\n",
      "Swift, a programming language developed by Apple, has some Python-inspired syntax.[198]\n",
      "Python's development practices have also been emulated by other languages. For example, the practice of requiring a document describing the rationale for, and issues surrounding, a change to the language (in Python, a PEP) is also used in Tcl,[199] Erlang,[200] and Swift.[201]\n",
